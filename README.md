# Arduino-Potential-Meter-
This is program i have designed it with arduino language to blink 3 different led at intervals . The knob allows current of range 0.0 to 5.0 to pass through it, then when the current is below 2.5 yellow led blinks and if its in between 2.5 and 3.5 green led lights up and lastly if its above 3.5 red led lights up. Have fun
